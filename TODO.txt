 - create test cases that cover all the possible optimizations and code
   generation scenario's.

 - clean up TODO/FIXMEs in the code

 - check for memory leaks

 - update mapping doc with latest data (or remove it)

 - MAYBE: align branch targets?

 - MAYBE: separate code generation into:
    symbolic code generation
    peephole optimization (only if optimizations are enabled)
    bytecode generation

Debugger:
 - functions to display/manipulate the current code position.
 - function to write to memory at an absolute address.

Long-term:
 - add profiling support to the VM (how?)

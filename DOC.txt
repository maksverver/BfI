An all-purpose Brainfuck VM.

Main features:
 - A clear execution model, fully enforced by the runtime environment.
   See LANGUAGE.txt for details.
 - High performance by using a just-in-time compiler to generate native code
   rather than interpret the Brainfuck code directly.

Detailed features:
 - Checks input for validity (i.e. detects unmatched brackets) when parsing.
 - By default detects all head-out-of-bounds errors at runtime.
 - Dynamically allocates memory as needed, so small and large programs alike
   can be executed quickly and efficiently without requiring tuning by the user.
 - Fast just-in-time compilation provides efficient execution of Brainfuck code.
 - Optimal optimization pass removes redundant operations and increases the
   efficiency of generated code. Although this optimization pass removes some
   bounds checks, out-of-bounds reads and writes are still detected.

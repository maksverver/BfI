- speed comparison on welcome.bf:
    naive interpreter:               10m 5s     (interpreter; gcc -O2)
    bytecode interpreter:             2m 9s     (interpreter2; gcc -O2)
    compile to C then to native:        35.5s   (bf2c; gcc -O3)
    JIT VM (without optimization):      35.2s   (bfi)
    JIT VM (with optimization):          1.2s   (bfi -O)

N.B. even with optimization disabled, the JIT VM does peephole optimizations.
